# Description
Latex is a markup language, like HTML, that gives you a way to type up documents that look clean and professional.

It is widely used across academia for [publications](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/academic-journal#.WsJaLujwaUk), [theses](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/thesis#.WsJaeujwaUk), and [books](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/book#.WsJaZ-jwaUk).

It is also gaining popularity elsewhere - for example, it's possible to use Latex to produce [resumes](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv#.WsJbnujwaUk), [reports](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/report#.WsJb2ujwaUk), or [presentations](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/presentation#.WsJbvujwaUk).

# Topics Covered
* How to get started qucikly with ShareLatex?
* How to create a basic document?
* How to work from a template?
* How to use a journal template?
* How to use the Tulane thesis and dissertation template?

# Get started with ShareLatex
1. Create an account on [ShareLatex.com](https://www.sharelatex.com)
2. Go to your Projects page, create a **New Project** and select **Blank Project**

ShareLatex:
* do not neet to worry about downloading and installing a Latex editor
* easy to use while learning
* can download files at any point to work offline
* can manage projects
* free (with restrictions)
* cand send editable or noneditable links

If you get stuck at any point, you can refer to the fully completed documents below.

If you're interested in learning more, there are also a number of ShareLatex projects that go deeper into the topics we covered available in the **References** section below. The source is also available in this repository, if you want to try downloading and compiling yourself.

All of the tools we discussed are also linked at the bottom.

# Lets Play!
* [Examples](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples) of actual LaTeX docs 
* [Write your first Latex document](https://github.com/ckearney07/latex-sp17-intro-workshop/blob/master/References/1%20-%20Minimal.tex)
* [ShareLatex default](https://github.com/ckearney07/latex-sp17-intro-workshop/blob/master/References/2%20-%20Sharelatex%20Default.tex)
	- When you start a new, blank, project in ShareLaTeX, the default document pre-populates a number of things for you, giving you a document that is guarantee to compile. The template utilizes a few more features than the minimal document, though.
* [Document Structure and Style](https://github.com/ckearney07/LatexIntroWorkshop/blob/master/References/3%20-%20Structure.tex)
	- Each class has a number of options you can specify. Common options might include font size, number of columns, margins, type of paper, etc.
	- There are also many, many classes to choose from. Each one provides a different default styling, and occasionally new commands you can use to further customize your formatting. Examples classes include: report, book, slides, article, letter
* [Math Equations](https://github.com/ckearney07/LatexIntroWorkshop/blob/master/References/4%20-%20Structure_Math.tex)
	- add in and out of line equations
* [Environments: Lists and tables](https://github.com/ckearney07/LatexIntroWorkshop/blob/master/References/5%20-%20Structure_Math_Environments)
	- What is an environment?
	- How to an environment?
* Next: Figures and Bibliographies
